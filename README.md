Your initials must be part of the filename, e.g., BPRD-01-XXX-YYY.fsx, where XXX and YYY are the names of the two working together. Both XXX and YYY must upload the same file. An example: BPRD-01-MadsAndersen-ConnieHansen.zip.

You can only upload one file and it must be one of the following file types: txt, fs, fax, pdf or zip. Use zip-files if you hand in a complete project or just more than one file.
